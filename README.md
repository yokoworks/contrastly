# Contrastly

Contrastly is an open-source color contrast checker that lets you select Tailwind colors directly from the palette—without looking up hex values or switching between tools.

It is designed for frontend developers, designers, and anyone working on accessibility-aware interface colors.

## Live App

- https://contrastly.solastudio.studio/

## Why this exists

Color contrast can look acceptable at first glance and still fail accessibility requirements.

When working on UI, contrast checking often involves moving between Tailwind documentation, hex converters, and separate contrast checker tools. Each step is useful, but the workflow can become more fragmented than it needs to be.

Contrastly brings those steps closer together: choose or enter colors, check contrast in real time, and see whether a color combination meets WCAG AA or AAA contrast requirements.

## Who it is for

Contrastly may be useful when you are:

- working with Tailwind CSS colors
- checking foreground and background color combinations
- designing accessible UI components
- learning about WCAG contrast requirements
- evaluating color combinations for semantic color tokens
- reviewing interface colors during implementation

It is especially useful when you want to move quickly while still keeping accessibility part of everyday frontend decisions.

## Features

- Tailwind color palettes included by default
- Custom hex color input
- Copy buttons for quick iteration
- Real-time WCAG AA / AAA contrast checks
- Keyboard-operable color selection
- Reduced-motion support
- Screen reader announcements for color selections and updated contrast results
- Fast, lightweight interface for everyday use

## How contrast is calculated

Contrastly checks color contrast using the WCAG 2.x contrast ratio formula.

```txt
contrast ratio = (L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05)
```

Where:

- `L1` is the relative luminance of the lighter color
- `L2` is the relative luminance of the darker color

Relative luminance is calculated from sRGB color values using the WCAG 2.x method before the contrast ratio is computed.

This makes the result comparable with other WCAG-based contrast checking tools.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Node.js 22
- npm

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`.

### Environment Variables

If you want to use environment variables locally, copy the example file first:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Available variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLA_STUDIO_URL=https://your-studio-url.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL=https://github.com/your-org/contrastly
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION=abc123xyz
```

Notes:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` should be set for production deployments. It is used for metadata, Open Graph tags, sitemap, and robots.txt.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` is optional. If omitted, no Google Analytics script is injected.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLA_STUDIO_URL` is optional. If omitted, the related footer link is not shown.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_REPOSITORY_URL` is optional. If omitted, the related footer link is not shown.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION` is optional. If set, the value is included as a Google site verification meta tag. This is a public value issued by Google Search Console and is safe to expose in HTML.

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Project Checks

```bash
npm run check
```

This runs:

- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run build`

### Browser and accessibility tests

Install the Chromium browser used by Playwright once:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

Run all browser tests:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Run only the automated axe accessibility checks:

```bash
npm run a11y:check
```

Useful interactive modes:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:headed
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

The axe tests fail on confirmed rule violations. Results that axe marks as
`incomplete` require human review and are preserved in the Playwright HTML
report as an attachment and annotation rather than being treated as a pass or
failure. Automated checks do not replace keyboard, screen reader, zoom, and
other manual accessibility testing.

## External Resources & Privacy

Contrast checking runs locally in the browser. The core color comparison logic does not rely on external API calls.

### Fonts

The Inter font is handled through `next/font` and served locally in production builds, so the app does not require runtime requests to Google Fonts servers.

### Analytics

Google Analytics 4 is optional. If `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` is not set, no analytics script is injected.

When analytics is enabled, the app uses a consent-aware setup. Analytics collection remains disabled until the user grants consent. Selected colors and other user-entered contrast values are not sent to analytics.

### Consent Storage

If the consent banner is enabled, the user's consent choice may be stored in browser-side storage so the preference can be remembered across visits.

## Accessibility Note

Contrastly is a helpful reference tool for checking color contrast, but it is not a substitute for a full accessibility audit, legal compliance review, or official certification.
